# Credit Scoring Classification

This project aims to build a classification model for credit scoring using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict whether a customer is a good or bad credit risk based on their financial and demographic information.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is not provided. However, it should contain relevant features such as income, employment status, credit history, and other factors that may influence credit risk.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- CatBoost

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:

1. Handling missing values using `SimpleImputer`.
2. Standardizing numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
3. Encoding categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.

## Model Building

The following classification algorithms are used in this project:

- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

The `confusion_matrix` and `classification_report` functions from Scikit-learn are used to calculate these metrics.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed.
3. Prepare your dataset and place it in the appropriate location.
4. Update the code with the correct path to your dataset.
5. Run the script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

# Disease Classification

This repository contains Python code for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- mlxtend

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. Loads the breast cancer dataset.
3. Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Performs feature selection using the SelectKBest method.
5. Scales the feature values using MinMaxScaler.
6. Trains and evaluates various classification models:
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
7. Optimizes hyperparameters of the models using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV.
8. Computes and prints classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for each model.
9. Plots confusion matrices for the models.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install the required libraries and modules.
3. Run the Python script.
4. The script will execute the code and print the classification metrics and confusion matrices for each model.
